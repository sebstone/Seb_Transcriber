# Seb_Transcriber
This project builds on a TirSu-Writer that my friend Landhund and i started about a year ago. The goal is to create a Transcriber to create an SVG from a text input using different script options. It will start with the Tir'Su script from the D&amp;D multiverse and should be expandable with different scripts using this codes framework.
